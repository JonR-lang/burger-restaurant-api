# WAJUSOFT SOFTWARE CHALLENGE

## Description

This is my entry for a simple API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete products, burger types, coupons, and orders.

Please note that because I am using a free instance of render to host my server, it takes sometime to spin up the server after being idle for a while.

# Base URL

The base URL for this API is [https://wajusoft-ecommerce-api.onrender.com](https://wajusoft-ecommerce-api.onrender.com).

## Base Path

All endpoints in this API have a base path of `/api/`.
For example, to GET all products(burgers) in the database, you would use [https://wajusoft-ecommerce-api.onrender.com/api/products](https://wajusoft-ecommerce-api.onrender.com/api/products).

## Overview

This API is designed to provide a backend for a burger restaurant, allowing for the management of users, products, burger types, coupons, and orders. It utilizes Express.js for the server, and MongoDB as the database.

The API includes the following features:

- User authentication and management
- Product management
- Burger type management
- Coupon management
- Order management
